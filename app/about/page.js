            Rema, born Divine Ikubor, is a Nigerian Afrobeat sensation who burst
            onto the global music scene with his unique blend of Afrobeat, trap,
            and pop sounds. Hailing from Benin City, Nigeria, Remaâ€™s rise to
            fame began in 2019 when he signed with Jonzing World, a subsidiary
            of Mavin Records, and released his debut self-titled EP Rema, which
            quickly garnered international attention. Known for his infectious
            melodies, versatile style, and captivating performances, Rema has
            become a trailblazer for the new generation of African artists,
            pushing the boundaries of Afrobeat on the global stage.
